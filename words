Qualcomm/Atheros QCA9558
MIPS74KEc - big-endian, no fpu
32 TLB

The SoC interrupt controller is a little derpy.

The Mask register doesn't seem to actually mask 
interrupts that come up on the stats register.  So 
the the mask register has to be read and compared 
to what is read from stats.

UART seems to be a regular 8250/16650 compatible.


The ethernet is mostly a Tulip 2114x compatible.

!!todo

This type of Mips cpu is said to benefit greatly from 
running the cache in write-back rather than write-through.
However, this requires rerwiting the ethernet driver to 
make sure caches are flushed from they need to be, and 
ddr fluch commands to make sure the ethernet device is 
sending packets to ram.

FreeBSD removed mips from later releases, check back to 13 
to find mips code.
